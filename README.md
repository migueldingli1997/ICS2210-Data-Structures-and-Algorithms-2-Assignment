# ICS2210 (Data Structures and Algorithms 2) Assignment

In the [solutions](https://github.com/migueldingli1997/ICS2210-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-2-Assignment/tree/master/Implementation), the main program can be run by executing Main.jar as follows: `java -jar Main.jar`. For the admissibility tests having to do with Uniform Cost Search, A* Search, and Iterative-Deepening A*, the admissibility test program can be run by executing the second .jar file as follows: `java -jar AdmissibilityTest.jar`.
